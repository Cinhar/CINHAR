            <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
            <p>Clinical Imaging Network for Health Awareness and Research (CINHAR)</p>
            <p>1. Role of CINHAR as an Implementing Agency:</p>
            <p>o CINHAR acts as a nonprofit implementing agency focused on advancing healthcare and research for the benefit of the community. Its primary function is to implement and manage projects that provide health and research benefits directly to the community through collaborations with academic and clinical institutions.</p>
            <p>2. International Funding:</p>
            <p>o CINHAR receives funds from international collaborations, especially from universities. However, CINHAR is not the direct recipient of the entire grant. Only the portion of the funds allocated for CINHAR’s role as the implementing agency will be transferred to CINHAR through the collaborating University.</p>
            <p>o Upon award of the Grant, the Funding agency will release the funds to the collaborating university. The PI of the collaborating University will then allocate the necessary amount to CINHAR based on the budgetary allocation as per the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) with the partnering Hospital/Clinical Center. These funds are used for project implementation, management, and proper functioning as per the CSA with the partnering Hospital/ Clinical Center.</p>
            <p>3. Participating Hospital/ Clinical Center and MOUs:</p>
            <p>o Participating Hospital/ Clinical Center that collaborate with CINHAR will have MOU specifically for a project to be implemented along with a detailed CSA. The MoUs will outline the details of the project, collaborating institutions, Data transfer policies, ethical guidelines and any non-disclosure and proprietary rights of CINHAR and the collaborating Hospital/Center. The MoU will also outline the terms and mechanisms of payments to be made by CINHAR for the clinical examinations, Scans and Reporting and the Consultancy Charges if any.</p>
            <p>o The CSA will provide detailed information on the technical and clinical aspects of the study and the specific budgetary requirements to be projected in the proposal to be submitted to the Collaborating University.</p>
            <p>o Hospitals/ Clinical Center may collaborate with CINHAR by signing of MoU and CSA, ensuring proper execution and governance of the research or healthcare projects.</p>
            <p>o Both CINHAR and the partnering Hospital/Center are expected to contribute expertise, resources, or data, depending on the nature of the project and outlined in.</p>
            <p>4. Requirements for Participating Scientists or Medical Doctors as Consultants:</p>
            <p>o Any scientist or medical doctor wishing to become a clinical or technical consultant for the project involving CINHAR shall have a clear-cut definition of their proposed contributions and service to the project and shall be projected in the MoU.</p>
            <p>o Consultants must align their work with CINHAR's mission of advancing health and research for community benefit.</p>
            <p>o The regulations will specify the criteria and guidelines for appointing consultants, ensuring that their qualifications and expertise match the objectives of the specific projects.</p>
            <p>5. Benefits from Imaging Data:</p>
            <p>o CINHAR projects involving imaging data must ensure that findings or benefits derived from the data serve the community in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Income-based benefits: The patients recruited by the participating Hospital/Center will receive the benefits of complimentary scans and clinical fee exemption as outlined in the CSA.</li>
                <li>Research-based benefits: The findings from the project should lead to actionable healthcare improvements for the community.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>6. Consideration of Projects by CINHAR:</p>
            <p>If a technical expert with ideas for clinical imaging studies seeks to collaborate with CINHAR, the organization can facilitate such partnerships, provided the proposal aligns with its mission. CINHAR's focus is on utilizing imaging data from community scans funded by research grants, with the ultimate goal of enhancing health awareness and supporting community well-being. By aligning proposals with these objectives, CINHAR fosters collaborations that leverage advanced imaging techniques to improve public health and drive scientific progress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposal Submission: Any institution or individual interested in collaborating with CINHAR must submit a proposal plan in the format specified in the Project Request Form (PRF), which can be downloaded from the CINHAR website at <a href="https://cinhar.github.io/">https://cinhar.github.io/</a></li>
                <li>Evaluation: The completed PRF should be emailed to the President of CINHAR, with contact details provided on the website. Each proposal will be evaluated by the CINHAR governing body to ensure alignment with the society’s mission and vision. Proposals that do not align with CINHAR’s objectives will not proceed to further stages of consideration.</li>
                <li>Institutional Endorsement: Individuals seeking collaboration must provide a letter from the head of their parent institution, outlining the terms and conditions of their involvement in the project.</li>
                <li>Application Review Process: The CINHAR Governing Body will review the application to assess the applicant’s suitability for the role of Investigator or Consultant. Applicants are required to email the following documents with the subject line “Project Collaboration Request”:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Curriculum Vitae (CV).</li>
                        <li>A letter from the parent institution confirming the individual’s current employment status, whether on contract or permanent basis.</li>
