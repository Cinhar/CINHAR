            <h3>Mission and Vision</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to improve community health through analysis of imaging data analysis and collaborative research, connecting experts to advance clinical studies in India.
            We aim to be a scientific society, fostering analysis of multi-centric imaging data to enhance community health.
            As part of our commitment, we provide free imaging scans to volunteering patients. Their participation supports global research efforts while improving access to advanced diagnostics, particularly in underserved communities.</p>

            <h3>Operational Model</h3>
            <p>CINHAR operates through a collaborative model, partnering with global experts to conduct both multi-centric and single-centric clinical imaging studies. 
            Funding is routed through collaborating universities, which allocate resources to CINHAR for project implementation. The network includes technical and clinical consultants from India, ensuring local expertise in project execution.
            CINHAR covers all imaging and clinical examination costs through research funds, making services free for the community. 
            Each project is led by a Principal Investigator (PI) abroad, supported by consultants in India, as well as coordinators and data analysts at each clinical imaging center. 
            Project details, goals, and budgets are formalized through MoUs and Clinical Study Agreements with the partnering clinical centers.</p>
